### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android app development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose!

### A little about me:
Whilst learning to code I have worked full-time as a Highway Engineer! I realised that a career shakeup was needed and have been retraining as an Android Dev in my spare time!

In 2022 I completed the MIT Introduction to Programming with Python course. 
Throughout 2023 I undertook the Google Android Basics with Compose course which I completed on the 30/12/2023 whilst still managing to progress my Highway Engineering career.  

My plans are to develop several apps for distribution on the Google Play Store. I will then be open to opportunities for developer roles.

I'm looking forward to the challenges that await!
