- Hilt Dependency Injection
- Retrofit 2 & Coil
- Version control using Github
- Wireframing & Design in Figma  

### A little about me:
Whilst learning to code I have worked full-time as a Highway Engineer! I've always been interested in coding and wanted to take my chance to get more involved with it!

In 2022 I completed the MIT Introduction to Programming with Python course. 
Throughout 2023 I undertook the Google Android Basics with Compose course in my spare time which I completed on the 30/12/2023 whilst still managing to progress my Highway Engineering career.  

I am currently in development of two Android apps and an Engineering application: 
 - Game Clock
     - A desktop clock app with background animations designed to help gamers keep an eye on their play time and provide a clock in a style that will match their game experience.
     - Custom Animations using Jetpack compose Animations - Launched Effect, Infinite Transitions, Animate Float, Color, Value, etc.
     - Custom Animations using AGSL (Android Graphics Shader Language) I have developed an understanding of how to use custom shaders and how to translate shaders from GLSL to AGSL (which have subtle yet important differences)
     - Custom UI elements such as the toggle row within the Settings menu. 
     - User Preferences Repoistory to persist app-wide data and settings such as the last opened clock theme and whether the app is full screen.
     - Room database for storing theme specific settings and the alarm repository.
     - Hilt for dependency injection to provide context and helper functions into the Alarm Workers.
     - Notifications for Alarms using NotificationCompat, AlarmManager, and Broadcast Reciever.
       
 - Hopeless Romantic
     - An app to help those like myself! An app that reminds people in relationships to do nice things for their partner if they're prone to forgetting to.

 - Sign Foundation Automated design
    - Grasshopper/Rhino to create a 3d parametric model of a sign, signpost, and foundation.
    - Using in-built automation tools to iterate towards the best designs based on carbon costs and structural stability.
    - Viktor to create a python web app to run the automated parametric model.
