### A little about me:
Whilst learning to code I have worked full-time as a Highway Engineer! I realised that a career shakeup was needed and have been retraining as an Android Dev in my spare time!

In 2022 I completed the MIT Introduction to Programming with Python course. 
Throughout 2023 I undertook the Google Android Basics with Compose course in my spare time which I completed on the 30/12/2023 whilst still managing to progress my Highway Engineering career.  

I am currently in development of two apps: 
 - Game Clock
     - A desktop clock app with background animations designed to help gamers keep an eye on their play time and provide a clock in a style that will match their game experience.
     - Custom Animations using Jetpack compose Animations - Launched Effect, Infinite Transitions, Animate Float, Color, Value, etc.
     - Custom Animations using AGSL (Android Graphics Shader Language) I have developed an understanding of how to use custom shaders and how to translate shaders from GLSL to AGSL (which have subtle yet important differences)
     - Custom UI elements such as the toggle row within the Settings menu. 
     - User Preferences Repoistory to persist app-wide data and settings such as the last opened clock theme and whether the app is full screen.
     - Room database for storing theme specific settings and the alarm repository.
     - Hilt for dependency injection to provide context and helper functions into the Alarm Workers.
     - Notifications for Alarms using NotificationCompat, AlarmManager, and Broadcast Reciever.
     - 
 - Hopeless Romantic - An app to help those like myself! An app that reminds people in relationships to do nice things for their partner if they're prone to forgetting to. 

I'm looking forward to the challenges that await!
